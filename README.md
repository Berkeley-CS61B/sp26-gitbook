# Fall 2025 Textbook

This is the Fall 2025 edition of the CS61B textbook. This book is intended as a written accompaniment for the lectures, as opposed to being a full data structures textbook.

If you are interested in a serious data structures textbook that covers the topics of this class, we recommend:

* Algorithms, 4th edition by Robert Sedgwick, Kevin Wayne
* Algorithms Illuminated by Tim Roughgarden
* The Art of Computer Programming (Volume 3) by Donald Knuth
